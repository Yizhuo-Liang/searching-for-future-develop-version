"Human use, population and technology have reached that certain stage where Mother Earth no longer accepts human's presence with silence"
- Dalai Lama


It is now 2057 AD, the Malthusian constraint has been been realized and 99% of human population is now extinct. You carry with you the item that determines the fate of humanity: the last string of DNA of the human species. To succeed in this task, you need to searh a habitable planet for the human species settle and populate. Our fate is now in your hands. All the best, soldier.
